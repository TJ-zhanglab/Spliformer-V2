# Spliformer-V2

Spliformer-V2 is a deep-learning tool based on Segment-NT architecture that predicts RNA splicing usage accross 18 tissues based on pre-mRNA sequences(more details, see [paper](). Spliformer can take a VCF file containing variants of interest with its genotype as an input and predict acceptor/donor usage. 

## ‚ú® Features

- Predicts splice site usage alterations from genetic variants  
- Supports genotype-aware prediction  
- Tissue-specific modeling across 18 human tissues  
- Accepts standard VCF inputs  
- Output in annotated VCF format
  
## üõ† Installation
The development environment has been tested on:

OS: Debian 6.1.140-1 (2025-05-22) x86_64

Python: 3.8.19

PyTorch (GPU): 2.4.1

We recommend creating a new Conda environment before using Spliformer-V2. You can first download Miniconda from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html, then create a new environment named spliformerv2 using the following command:
```
conda env create -f spliformerV2.yml
``` 

## üöÄ Usage
After cloning the repository, run the example using the command below:
```sh
cd Spliformer-V2
python run.py \
  -I ./example/input/input19.vcf \
  -O ./output/output.vcf \
  -R ./reference/hg19.fa \
  -A ./reference/grch37.txt \
  -T LMC \
  -G 1 \
  -M 0
```
**‚öôÔ∏è Required parameters**


-   -I: Input VCF with variants of interest.
-   -O: Output VCF with prediction of Spliformer-V2
-   -R: Reference fasta file of human genome. Please download and unzip it to the reference folder first before making prediction from [GRCh37/hg19](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/hg19.fa.gz) or [GRCh38/hg38](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.fa.gz).
-   -A: Annotation file of human genome.  We created hg19/hg38 genome annotation file according to the GENCODE v39 gtf file. The files locate in the [./reference/](https://github.com/TJ-zhanglab/Spliformer-V2/tree/main/reference).
-   -T: Tissues for prediction
-   -G: Provide genotype in the VCF (1: provided; 0: not provided)
  
**‚öôÔ∏è Optional parameters**


-   -M: Mask predicted scores with annotated acceptor/donor gain and unannotated acceptor/donor loss. ```0: not masked; 1: masked``` (default: 0).
